### Project description

This project uses data science to predict an individual's gas usage for a future period of time. The project takes into account historical data, current gas prices, and forecasts to help users save money, reduce their environmental impact, and make better decisions.

### Repo contents

* `Gas-Bill-Prediction-updated.twb`: Tableau file containing the gas usage prediction model
* `GasUsageHistory.xlsx`: Excel file containing the gas usage data source
* `Screenshots`: Folder containing screenshots of the Tableau file

### Getting started

To use this project, you will need to have Tableau installed on your computer. Once you have Tableau installed, open the `Gas-Bill-Prediction-updated.twb` file.

The Tableau file contains a single dashboard with a variety of visualizations that show the gas usage prediction model. Users can interact with the dashboard to explore the data and learn more about the prediction model.

### How to use the gas usage prediction model

To use the gas usage prediction model, users simply enter their historical gas usage data into the Tableau dashboard. The model will then use this data to predict their gas usage for a future period of time.

Users can use the prediction model to:

* Budget for their gas expenses
* Make decisions about their travel plans
* Reduce their environmental impact
